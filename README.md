# fromFastatoCSV
Python program to transform a FASTA file to CSV file. In this example the file './pdb_seqres.txt' (from the protein data bank: https://www.rcsb.org/) is transformed

You can downloado the file pdb_seqres.txt here: ftp://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/derived_data/pdb_seqres.txt


In bioinformatics, FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either 
nucleotide or peptide sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids 
are represented using single-letter codes. 

The output file will contain : 
pdb id, chain, type, length (number of amino acids), family name, number of hydrophobic residues,  % of hydrophobic,  number of polar residues, % of polar residues,  number of aromatic residues, %aromatic residues,  number of positive charged residues, % positive charged residues, number of negative charged residues, % negative charged residues
